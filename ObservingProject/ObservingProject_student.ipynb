    "\n",
    "<p>This requires a bit more work because you want to look at the color-magnitude diagram of the cluster to get some sense of how faint you need to observe to get a decent chunk of the CMD.  Assume that in a given band you don’t want to have to expose for longer than 15 minutes in total and that you want to get photometry in the *g* and *r* bands.  You also want a signal-to-noise (SNR) of at least 15 for your faintest stars.  To calculate the faintest star that you can observe in 15 minutes at an SNR=15 you need to do a computation. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Because the camera is new, we don't know how many counts we get for a star of a certain brightness in the *g* and *r* filters.  Instead, we know from previous experience what these numbers are for the *B* and *V* filters, though these filters are not mounted on the telescope at the current time.  We will therefore do the compuation for the *B* and *V* filters and assume that the answers are similar as for the *g* and *r* filters.  In practice, this is not a perfect assumption, but it serves our purpose here and the *B* and *V* magnitudes we compute will be within 0.3 to 0.5 mag of the *g* and *r* mag.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our detector and telescope a star of 20th magnitude in B and V gets 889 and 953 photons respectively in a 100s exposure.  The star’s light is spread over 10 pixels.  Let us conservatively (because the brightness is high then) assume that we are observing 1 day from full moon.  In that case the background per pixel is 194.2 and 144.8 in the B and V band respectively in a 100 sec. exposure.  Every pixel in our detector has a random signal (or noise) that is introduced whenever the signal is read out from the detector.  This \"readnoise\" is 3.7 counts per pixel.  Describe in a text cell below your computational cell whether or not you can neglect the read noise when determining the signal to noise, and why?\n",
    "    \n",

    "<b>(10 points) Your code should print out the following, with explanatory text.  There should be separate values given for B and V.  Each part is worth 3 points:\n",
    "    <li>a) total number of background counts in B and V in 15min for the 10 pixels in an object aperture;\n",
    "    <li>b) the noise from the background in 15min for the summed pixels in an object aperture;\n",
    "    <li>c) the number of counts in 15min for B and V that correspond to the desired SNR=20;\n",
    "    <li>d) the number of counts in B and V for a 20th magnitude star in 15min;\n",
    "    <li>e) the magnitude in B and V corresponding to the limiting number of counts in c).\n",
    "</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this calculation, assume the gain is 1.  This means that if I get one photon, my CCD counts 1 electron.  Since Poisson noise is computed on the incident photons and not the number of measured electrons, you need to convert your counts to photons.  We will assume for now that this is a 1-to-1 conversion (Gain=1).  This is not correct but will be ok for this calculation."
