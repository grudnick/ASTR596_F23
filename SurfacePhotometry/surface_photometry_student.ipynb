    "\n",
    "This lab will be done via a mixture of python commands using the photutils aperture photometry package (https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/aperture.html) and the photutils isophote fitting package (https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/isophote.html).  We will also be using imexam and ds9.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will learn how to do the following things:\n",
    "* estimate the background for an image and subtract it;\n",
    "* estimate initial guesses for input parameters to an isophotal fitting code using ds9;\n",
    "* fit elliptical isophotes;\n",
    "* use photometry within these isophotes to measure the radial profile of various parameters;\n",
    "* compute the radius within which half the total light is contained.  This is called the effective radius.\n",
