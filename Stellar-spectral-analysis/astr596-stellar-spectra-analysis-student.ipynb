If you don't have a lot of computing experience, you should try an approximation for the filter shape that will allow you to better compute the average flux within the filter (*note the filter curves are fairly flat with sharp edges*).  If you want to try something more challenging, you can code up the full filter integral. Regardless of your choice, with that value of fnu, compute the AB magnitudes and filters as in the exercise above. \n",

Let me know if you're interested and I can help you do this.\n",

This package actually integrates the filter curves.  **Note that you will not get credit for just matching the correct answer.
