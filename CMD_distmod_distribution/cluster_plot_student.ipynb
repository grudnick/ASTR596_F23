    "This exercise is intended to give you a practical exercise in determining the distance to star clusters in the milky way.  You will do this by plotting the color-magnitude diagrams of 4 clusters compared to that of a cluster with a known distances.  This \"reference\" cluster is the nearby Pleiades (M 45), which is visible to the naked eye in late fall/winter.  It has a distance of 130pc.\n",

    "For each cluster you will use the code to plot that cluster and input color and magnitude shifts to align the cluster with the Pleiades.  Using your knowledge of how distance affects color and magnitude, you will need to decide if you use color shifts, magnitude shifts, or both.\n",

    "Using these shifts you will write a snippet of code below each plot in the space provided.  This code should be a short calculation to determine what the distance is based on the shifts. \n",
